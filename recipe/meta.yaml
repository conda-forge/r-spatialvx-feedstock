  summary: Spatial forecast verification arose from verifying high-resolution forecasts, where
    coarser-resolution models generally are favored even when a human forecaster finds
    the higher-resolution model to be considerably better.  Most newly proposed methods,
    which largely come from image analysis, computer vision, and similar, are available,
    with more on the way.
